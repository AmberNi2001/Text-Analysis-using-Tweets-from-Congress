# Text-Analysis-using-Tweets-from-Congress
This repository contains R codes and Rmarkdown for a text analysis project. It covers document sampling, preprocessing (tokenization, noise removal), and analysis like word clouds and TF-IDF to identify discriminative features between documents. It also includes dictionary-based classification (sentiment) and measurement of document similarity.
