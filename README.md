## Project Description
This repository contains raw data, R codes and R Markdown for a text analysis project focused on processing and analyzing textual contents in tweets from congress people. The project employs various natural language processing techniques and follows a systematic workflow including document sampling, preprocessing (tokenizing, cleaning, and stemming), exploratory analysis (word clouds and TF-IDF to visualize word frequencies and highlight discriminative terms), classification (e.g, sentiment), and similarity analysis (e.g, cosine similarity).
